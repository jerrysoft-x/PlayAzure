# PlayAzure

This is a repository that I can store azure script samples as many as I need.

## The following will be some small tests for playing markdown

```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```
        
```python
def foo():
    if not bar:
        return True
```
